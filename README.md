# Iberian Swadesh

This repository assembles Swadesh lists of the languages spoken in the Iberian Peninsula, collected by BA students in Linguistics from the University of Porto. 
It aims at making data about these languages accessible and tidy in order to facilitate quantitative analysis. This project is still in development.
Words are presented both in orthographic and phonetic form.  

This folder contains: \
[Data](data.csv): Swadesh lists of Romance languages from the Iberian Peninsula\
[Metadata](metadata.csv): Bibliographical reference of each list and name of the student who collected it.
